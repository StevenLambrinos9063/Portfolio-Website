        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Steven Lambrinos, an aspiring Network and Security Specialist with a passion for problem-solving, cybersecurity, and networking.</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from Humber College with an Advanced Diploma in Computer Engineering and have hands-on experience troubleshooting IT issues, configuring networks, and managing security vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm working toward earning my CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications. My experience includes building and deploying a smart parking lot system, performing network security analysis, and working with firewalls, ticketing systems, and dynamic routing protocols.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I value time with my family and friends. I also have a passion for cars, often working on them with my dad—though, let’s be real, it's mostly me getting yelled at for holding the flashlight wrong! At the end of the day, it’s time spent together, and that’s what matters.</p>
